description: Operate AWS CLI (`aws`) for authentication checks, profile and region context inspection, service command planning, and safe command execution. Use when tasks mention AWS CLI commands, profiles/regions, STS identity checks, or AWS service operations from terminal workflows.

# AWS CLI

## Workflow
1. Run preflight before AWS CLI workflows.
2. Check authentication and identity (`sts get-caller-identity`).
3. Confirm active profile and region context.
4. Choose a service command track and inspect first.
5. Require explicit confirmation before mutating commands.

## Preflight
Use bundled scripts:
- `scripts/aws-preflight.sh`
- `scripts/aws-auth-status.sh`
- `scripts/aws-context.sh`
- `scripts/aws-diagnostics.sh [--json] [--out <file>]`

## Core Command Tracks
- Identity and context:
`aws sts get-caller-identity`, `aws configure list-profiles`, `aws configure get region`
- Service inspection:
`aws <service> list-*`, `aws <service> describe-*`, `aws <service> get-*`
- Output and filtering:
Use `--query` (JMESPath) and `--output json|table|yaml`.
- Profile and region targeting:
Use `--profile` and `--region` explicitly for multi-account workflows.

## Safety Guardrails
- Inspect commands first, then propose mutations.
- Ask for explicit confirmation before `create`, `put`, `update`, `delete`, `terminate`, or policy changes.
- Avoid exposing credential values or sensitive account details.
- Use the narrowest scope possible (resource ARN/ID, profile, and region).

## Troubleshooting
- If identity checks fail, verify credentials/profile and re-run `scripts/aws-auth-status.sh`.
- If region is missing, set `AWS_REGION` or configure region for the active profile.
- If endpoint/network calls fail, capture diagnostics first and retry when connectivity is available.
